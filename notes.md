what are the types of data that control a component:

PROPS & STATE

PROPS are set by the parent and they are fixed throughout the lifetune of a component . for data that is going to change we use STATE

## Gesture responder system
manages the lifecycle of festures in the app. For example, a tapp can become a scroll

## DIP
density independent pixels
what is used to determine the width of components across devices
physical pixels = DIPS x Scale factor 
eg: {"fontScale": 1, "height": 856.1777777777778, "scale": 2.8125, "width": 384}

## Scroll View vs FLATList view:
render list of similar items or array / data is very big: FLATLIST
Render generic content in a sccrollable container and data is small: SCROLLVIEW

## Flexbox

In react native, flexbox aligns items to column by default
POSITION is be default RELATIVE

## Align-content:
only works when wrapping is enabled
